# Duet3D integration for Home Assistant

Code Based on the OctoPrint integration from Hass: [octoprint integration github](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/octoprint)

I forked from https://github.com/garethbradley/hass-Duet3D because his version uses a soon-to-be deprecated API endpoint /rr_status instead of /rr_model

This is a work in progress, the code is working but there is still lots to do

## Installation

Well obviously you're reading this in HACS so chances are you already installed this ;-)

### Config
The following configuration is taken from the excellent article: [Getting started with Duet Wifi, RepRapFirmware, and Home Assistant](https://begala.io/home-assistant/duet-wifi-feat-home-assistant/).

Add the following config to the `/config/configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Duet Integration
duet3d_printer:
  host: <hostname or IP address of your printer, e.g. 192.168.1.100>
  name: <name the printer should have in Home Assistant, e.g. My Printer>
  number_of_tools: 1
  bed: true
  sensors:
    monitored_conditions:
      - 'Current State'
      - 'Temperatures'
      - 'Job Percentage'
      - 'Time Elapsed'
      - 'Time Remaining'
      - 'Job Name'
      - 'Position'
      - 'Filament Amount'
      - 'Filament Used'
```

Add the following to your Lovelace dashboard. Remember to update the entity names with those of your own printer (defined by the value of `duet3d-name`)
```yaml
- card:
    cards:
      - type: glance
        entities:
          - entity: sensor.<your-printer-name>_current_toolbed_temp
            name: Bed
          - entity: sensor.<your-printer-name>_current_tool1_temp
            name: Tool
          - entity: sensor.<your-printer-name>_current_state
            name: Status
    type: horizontal-stack
  conditions:
    - entity: switch.<your-printer-name>
      state: 'on'
  type: conditional
```
